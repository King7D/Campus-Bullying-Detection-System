# Campus Bullying Detection and Prevention System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a system that can automatically detect bullying behaviors in campus dialogues, helping schools and educators more effectively prevent and intervene in bullying incidents. The system is based on machine learning technology, monitoring and analyzing students' daily conversations to detect potential bullying behaviors and provide timely warnings for appropriate actions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Library**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: pandas
- **Text Processing**: TF-IDF Vectorizer

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect campus dialogue data and preprocess it for machine learning model training.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Train a Polynomial Naive Bayes model on the dialogue data and evaluate it on a test set.
- **Bullying Detection**: Identify whether dialogues contain bullying behaviors.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback and warnings when bullying behaviors are detected.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed classification reports to assess model performance.

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure your environment has Python and necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) installed.
2. Download or clone this repository to your computer.
3. Run it to train the model and perform predictions.
4. Take appropriate actions based on the model's output results.

## Notes

- This project is for educational and research purposes only and should not be used for actual bullying detection in the environment.
- The authenticity and accuracy of the dialogue data are crucial for the model's performance; ensure the quality of the data.
- Further work is needed to optimize the model and consider more bullying detection features.
